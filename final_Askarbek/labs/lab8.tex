satisfies the inequality

$$
| f(x) | < \epsilon
$$


if $0 < x < \delta = \epsilon / 2 $ . However, this does not mean that $\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} f(x) = 0 $ since $f$ is
not defined for negative $x$, as it must be to satisfy the conditions of Definition 2.1.2 with
$x_0 = 0 $ and $L=0$ . The function

$$
g(x) = x +  \frac{|x|}{x}  ,   \neq  0 ,
$$

can be rewritten as

$$
g(x)  x =
\begin{cases}
x+1 & x > 0\\
x-1 & x < 0
\end{cases}
$$

hence, every open interval containing $x_0 =0 $ also contains points x1 and x2 such that
$|g(x_1)- g(x_2) |$ is as close to 2 as we please. Therefore, $\lim_{x \rightarrow x_0} g(x)$ does not exist
(Exercise 26)


Although $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ do not approach limits as x approaches zero, they each exhibit
a definite sort of limiting behavior for small positive values of $x$, as does $g(x)$ for small
negative values of $x$. The kind of behavior we have in mind is defined precisely as follows.

\textbf{Definition 2.1.2}

 We say that $f(x)$ approaches the left-hand limit $L$ as $x$ approaches $x_0$ from the left,
and write

$$
\lim_{x \rightarrow x_0} f(x) = L.
$$


if $f$ is defined on some open interval $(a,x_0)$ and, for each $\epsilon > 0$, there is a $ \delta > 0$
such that

$$
|f(x) - L| < \epsilon \text{ if }  x_0 - \delta < x < x_0.
$$
